 Three versions of the grapher are provided, due to a current lack of standardised presentation of the Vivado unit data.

-the "doc format" refers to unit information as provided by the[ AMD website](https://download.amd.com/docnav/documents/ip_attachments/floating-point.html?utm_)
-the "flopoco format" refers to unit formation which would be formatted identically to the current report csv used for flopoco data. This would be the best way going forwards, but discrepancies in the flopoco and vivado flows means it's not currently in use.
-the "manual" format refers to the user manually filling in the data of the vivado units wanted. This is obviously inelegant, but is currently used for data obtained from Vivado reports on the vivado units.
